If I should think of love 
I'd think of you, your arms uplifted, 
Tying your hair in plaits above, 
The lyre shape of your arms and shoulders, 
The soft curve of your winding head. 
No melody is sweeter, nor could Orpheus 
So have bewitched. I think of this, 
And all my universe becomes perfection. 
But were you in my arms, dear love, 
The happiness would take my breath away, 
No thought could match that ecstasy, 
No song encompass it, no other worlds. 
If I should think of love, 
I'd think of you.
